what is unittest in python?

unittest is a testing framework built into Python's standard library. It provides a set of tools for writing and running
automated tests for Python code. The goal of unittest is to make it easy to write tests that are repeatable, maintainable,
and scalable.

With unittest, you can define test cases and test suites, which contain one or more test cases. A test case is a unit of
testing that checks a specific behavior or function of your code. You can use a variety of assert methods to check that
the output of your code matches the expected results.
