what is unittest in python?

unittest is a testing framework built into Python's standard library. It provides a set of tools for writing and running
automated tests for Python code. The goal of unittest is to make it easy to write tests that are repeatable, maintainable,
and scalable.

With unittest, you can define test cases and test suites, which contain one or more test cases. A test case is a unit of
testing that checks a specific behavior or function of your code. You can use a variety of assert methods to check that
the output of your code matches the expected results.

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software application are tested in
isolation from the rest of the system. The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each unit or component of the
application works correctly as per its design specifications.

In unit testing, a test case is created for each unit or component of the application, which is then executed to verify
the expected behavior of that unit. The test case typically consists of a set of inputs and expected outputs, which are
used to verify the correctness of the unit.

Unit testing is typically automated using specialized testing frameworks such as JUnit for Java, NUnit for .NET, and
pytest for Python. These frameworks provide tools for defining and executing test cases, as well as reporting on test results.

Unit testing is an important part of the software development process as it helps to catch defects early in the development
cycle, which can significantly reduce the cost and time required to fix them. It also helps to improve the overall quality
of the software by ensuring that each unit works as expected and integrates correctly with other units in the system.

In unit testing, isolation means testing individual units or components of the application in isolation from the rest of
the system. This is typically achieved by mocking or stubbing out any external dependencies or interactions that the unit
 might have with other parts of the system.

For example, if you have a function that makes a network request to retrieve some data, you would typically use a mocking
library to simulate the network request and provide a fake response for the unit to work with during testing.

In terms of implementation, isolation can be achieved using various techniques, including using classes and frameworks
such as unittest in Python. The unittest framework provides a TestCase class that you can use to define test cases for
individual units or components of your application.

When using unittest, you would typically define a separate test class for each unit or component of your application that
you want to test. Within each test class, you would define individual test methods that exercise specific behaviors or
scenarios for that unit.

For example, you might define a test_add() method within a CalculatorTestCase class that tests the behavior of the add()
method of a Calculator class.

Overall, the goal of isolation in unit testing is to ensure that each unit is tested independently of other units or
components of the system, so that you can identify and fix defects in a controlled and predictable manner.
